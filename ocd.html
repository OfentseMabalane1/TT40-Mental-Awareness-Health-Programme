        <h2>What is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)?</h2>
        <p>
            Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition characterized by recurring, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions) that interfere with daily life. These obsessions and compulsions are intrusive and distressing, causing significant distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning.
        </p>

        <h3>Symptoms of OCD</h3>
        <h4>Obsessions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unwanted thoughts:</strong> Intrusive thoughts, urges, or mental images that cause anxiety and are difficult to control.</li>
            <li><strong>Common themes:</strong> Fear of germs or contamination, fear of losing or misplacing something, worries about harm coming towards yourself or others, unwanted forbidden thoughts involving sex or religion, and need for things to be lined up exactly or arranged in a particular way.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Compulsions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Repetitive behaviors:</strong> Actions performed to reduce anxiety or stop the obsessive thoughts, such as excessive cleaning and/or handwashing, repeatedly checking on things, compulsive counting, and ordering and arranging things in a particular way.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Avoiding situations that trigger obsessions, such as refusing to shake hands or touch objects that other people touch a lot.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Causes of OCD</h3>
        <p>
            The exact cause of OCD is unknown, but several factors are thought to contribute to its development, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Family history, especially if a first-degree relative developed OCD as a child or teen.</li>
            <li><strong>Brain structure and functioning:</strong> Differences in certain parts of the brain, which may be linked to OCD.</li>
            <li><strong>Childhood trauma:</strong> Experiences such as child abuse, which may be associated with the development of OCD.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Diagnosis of OCD</h3>
        <p>
            OCD is diagnosed based on the presence of obsessions and compulsions that interfere with daily life. The diagnosis is typically made by a healthcare provider after a thorough evaluation of symptoms and medical history. The provider may use criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-V) to diagnose OCD.
        </p>

        <h3>Treatment of OCD</h3>
        <h4>Therapies</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Psychotherapy:</strong> Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), specifically exposure and response prevention (ERP), which helps individuals learn to manage their obsessions and compulsions.</li>
            <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which can help reduce symptoms.</li>
            <li><strong>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS):</strong> A brain stimulation procedure that targets specific brain areas associated with OCD.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Statistics and Research</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Prevalence:</strong> OCD affects approximately 1.6% to 2.3% of the general U.S. population.</li>
            <li><strong>Age of onset:</strong> Typically begins in adolescence or early adulthood, with about 50% of people with OCD starting to experience symptoms in childhood and adolescence.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk factors:</strong> Family history, brain structure and functioning, and childhood trauma are all thought to contribute to the development of OCD.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Living with OCD</h3>
        <p>
