      <h2>What is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)?</h2>
      <p>
        Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that
        can develop after a person experiences or witnesses a traumatic event.
        This can include events such as military combat, natural disasters,
        serious accidents, or violent crimes. PTSD can cause significant
        distress and impairment in daily life, making it essential to seek
        professional help if symptoms persist.
      </p>

      <h3>Symptoms of PTSD</h3>
      <h4>Common Symptoms</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Intrusive Memories:</strong> Recurring, unwanted memories of
          the traumatic event, which can be triggered by various stimuli.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Avoidance:</strong> Avoiding situations, places, or people
          that remind the individual of the traumatic event.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hyperarousal:</strong> Increased anxiety, hypervigilance, and
          exaggerated startle response.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dissociation:</strong> Feeling disconnected from oneself or
          the world around them.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Causes of PTSD</h3>
      <h4>Traumatic Events</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Direct Exposure:</strong> Directly experiencing or witnessing
          a traumatic event.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Indirect Exposure:</strong> Learning about a traumatic event
          through others, such as through media or family members.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Diagnosis of PTSD</h3>
      <h4>Criteria</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>DSM-5 Criteria:</strong> The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
        of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) provides the diagnostic
        criteria for PTSD, which include the presence of symptoms for at least
        one month after the traumatic event.
      </p>

      <h3>Treatment of PTSD</h3>
      <h4>Therapies</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):</strong> A
          well-established treatment for PTSD, which helps individuals identify
          and change negative thought patterns and behaviors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Exposure Therapy:</strong> Gradually exposing individuals to
          stimuli associated with the traumatic event to help them become
          desensitized.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR):</strong>
          A therapy that uses bilateral stimulation to help individuals process
          traumatic memories.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):</strong> Focuses on
          teaching individuals skills to manage distressing emotions and
          thoughts while living according to their values.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Medications</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs):</strong>
          Antidepressants that can help alleviate symptoms of PTSD.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Serotonin-Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs):</strong>
          Medications that can be used to treat PTSD, especially when SSRIs are
          ineffective.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Statistics and Research</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Prevalence:</strong> PTSD affects approximately 6-8% of the
          general population, with higher rates among those who have experienced
          traumatic events.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Risk Factors:</strong> A history of trauma, mental health
          conditions, and certain personality traits can increase the risk of
          developing PTSD.
        </li>
      </ul>
